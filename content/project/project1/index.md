This quick example is designed to provide one approach to getting a sense of market pricing using consumer surveys. This approach uses the van Westendorp Pricing Model.

This model is based on asking four questions of consumers about a test product:

At which price on this scale you are beginning to experience . . . (test-product) as too cheap – so that you say “at this price the quality cannot be good”?

At which price on this scale are you beginning to experience (test-product) as cheap?

At which price on this scale are you beginning to experience (test-product) as expensive?

At which price on this scale you are beginning to experience (test-product) as too expensive – so that you would never consider buying it yourself?

Using the consumer responses to these four questions, the cumulative distribution of responses can mapped against the prices develop 4 curves for analysis: Too Cheap (tch), Cheap (ch), Expensive (ex), Too Expensive (tex).
