I collected and organized data covering nearly six million home mortgage observations and used this data to build mortgage default and mortgage prepayment forecasting models associated with asset-baeked securities.  The models were constructed using survival analysis and a time-dependent covariate version of the Cox Proportional Hazards model for prediction. Additionally, interest rate, county-level unemployment rate, and regional home price index forecasting models were also created for mortgage-related analysis."""
