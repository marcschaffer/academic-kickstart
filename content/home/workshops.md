**Data Visualization Principles + Storytelling: An Introduction**

This 120-minute session will provide an overview of data visualization principles and storytelling with data.  This session will focus on why we visualize data, the psychology of visualization, an introduction to chart types, refining visuals for impact, the data visualization process, and lastly an introduction to a story-based approach to presenting data.

*Workshop is geared for all audiences and is aimed at introducing these topics and ideas at a high level.*

**Data Visualization: Designing for Impact**

This 60 or 90-minute workshop is geared towards designing static data visualizations for impact.  The key premise of this workshop assumes data visualization consumers will give visuals a maximum of 5-seconds of their attention.  How do we approach designing visuals that are meaningful, impactful, and clearly understood within 5 seconds?  This session takes a deeper dive into design principles ranging from an introduction to chart types, visualization structure and hierarchy, design simplification and clarification techniques, and strategies for amplifying the key design takeaways.

*Workshop is aimed at all audiences and workshop could be combined with a tools training component with examples customized to audience focus area.*

**Data Visualization: Chart Type Exploration**

This 90 or 120-minute workshop is designed to explore the world of charts.  When making a data visualization, why would you use a line chart vs. a bar chart vs. a waffle chart vs. a beeswarm plot?  Advances in technology of vastly improved the tool kit of data analytics and business intelligence experts to use a variety of charts that extend beyond the standard tool kit of visual presented in mainstream software programs.  The goal of this workshop is to develop a process of chart selection and exposure participants to various forms of charts that can be used to better tell the story in their data.

*Workshop is aimed at all audiences, but is best geared towards to BI and analytics professionals. This workshop is best combined with a tools training component geared towards creating new chart types.*

**Exploratory Data Analysis: A Data Visualization Approach**

This 60 or 90-minute workshop is aimed at developing a process and approach to exploring a dataset for stories.  How do you start to explore your data?  Have a dataset with a couple million observations and a hundred variables that needs to be explored?  The goal of this workshop is to develop a strategy for exploring this dataset to systematically to better understand stories of individual variables, as well as the relationships between variables, all while using a data visualization approach.

*Workshop is geared towards BI and analytics professionals.  This workshop is best combined with a tools training and possibly exposure to introductory coding using open-source coding platforms for efficient exploratory data analysis (EDA).*

**Data + Stories: Presenting for Impact**

This 60 or 90-minute workshop is designed to bring data to life.  How do you tell a story with data?  Can you use a narrative approach to presenting data and information for your audience?  This workshop will explore the principles of storytelling and story arcs and seek to apply these principles to dynamic presentations.  The goal is offer strategies for turning those standard boardroom data-driven presentations into strategic, intentional, design-driven narratives using data as a powerful force for impact.

*Workshop is geared towards all audiences and would be valuable for any professionals that give presentations using data.*
