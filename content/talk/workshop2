summary:
abstract:This 60 or 90-minute workshop is geared towards designing static data visualizations for impact.  The key premise of this workshop assumes data visualization consumers will give visuals a maximum of 5-seconds of their attention.  How do we approach designing visuals that are meaningful, impactful, and clearly understood within 5 seconds?  This session takes a deeper dive into design principles ranging from an introduction to chart types, visualization structure and hierarchy, design simplification and clarification techniques, and strategies for amplifying the key design takeaways.

Workshop is aimed at all audiences and workshop could be combined with a tools training component with examples customized to audience focus area.
